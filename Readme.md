This package includes classes and tools for analyzing optical measurements in the Orenstein Group, based on the data formatting generated by running experiments with the OrensteinLab package.

At the core of the package is the Measurement class, which is a container for data that takes in a data file and generates a dictionary based on the imported data. Inherited classes can then be used to specify more specific types of data objects.

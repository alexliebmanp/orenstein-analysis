This package includes classes and tools for analyzing optical measurements in the Orenstein Group, based on the data formatting generated by running experiments with the OrensteinLab package.

This package is based on xarray. The main reasons for this are (1) functionality for working with n-d data arrays as found in complex maps,
(2) extensibility to new kinds of measurement modalities and datasets, (3) searchability. xarray was chosen over Pandas because of the anticipated use for mulitdimensional applications. One possible drawback is that Pandas is optimized for sparse arrays.

A few open questions are: (1) is it necessary to use xarray structures from the beginning? (2) If not, what is the alternative? (3) In what situations should the code refer back to pandas or numpy?

At the core of the package is the Measurement class,  which is a container for data that takes in a data file and generates a dictionary based on the imported data. Inherited classes can then be used to specify more specific types of data objects.




The syntax for this package needs to be consistent, intuitive, and clear. All data is stored in a xarray Dataset as a DataArray. To distinguish from the xarray syntax so as to avoid confusion between code native to xarray and code native to this package, we will often refer to a Dataset as a measurement. Sometimes, however, the two terms are used interchangeably. If needed, DataArrays will be referred to as measurement_data

In addition, the package is divided into two module categories. (1) measurement methods, which are general purpose and do not reference any specific type of experiment, and (2) experimental methods, which is a space to add specific functionality on top of the measurement methods.
